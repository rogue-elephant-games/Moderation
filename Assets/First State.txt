Another typical day, I open up my forum moderator admin site and go through newly added posts.
There are a lot more posts than normal, usually I would expect about 10 new posts but today there are 33!

That's a lot of posts to get through!

What should I do?
1. Start with the oldest.
2. Start with the newest.
